When my mind is all a flutter from living day to day
Your music's like a river, I can gently float away
When I'm deep in disappointment, and cannot face the night
Your music lifts me up and takes me closer to the light
You nurtured me in childhood, you're a haven for my soul
Mother country music let your guitars roll on
There's a refuge for my trouble... s... in your songs

You helped me through the darkest nights, when I thought I was alone
And when I found a new love, you gave me a love song
When my heart is broken and everything goes wrong
It helps to ease my mind, when I hear it in your song
You nurtured me in childhood, you're a haven for my soul
Mother country music let your guitars roll on
There's a refuge for my trouble... s... in your songs
