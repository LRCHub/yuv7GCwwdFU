You see that mountain over there? Yeah?
One of these days, I'm gonna climb that mountain

Oh, play me some mountain music
Like grandma and grandpa used to play
Then I'll float on down the river
To a Cajun hideaway

Drift away like Tom Sawyer
Ride a raft with ol' Huck Finn
Take a nap like Rip Van Winkle
Daze dreamin' again

Oh, play me some mountain music
Like grandma and grandpa used to play
Then I'll float on down the river
To a Cajun hideaway

Swim across the river
Just to prove that I'm a man
Spend the day bein' lazy
Just bein' nature's friend

Climb a long tall hick'ry
Bend it over, skinnin' cats
Playin' baseball with chert rocks
Usin' sawmill slabs for bats

Play some back-home, come-on music
That comes from the heart
Play somethin' with lots of feelin'
'Cause that's where music has to start

Oh, play me some mountain music
Like grandma and grandpa used to play
Then I'll float on down the river
To a Cajun hideaway, hey, hey!

Oh, play me mountain music
Oh, play me mountain music
Oh, play me mountain music
Oh, play (yee-haw!)
