Joe don't let your music kill ya
It's a thing that supposed to fill ya
It's a thing that supposed to make you happy

Taking pills and drinking whiskey
Picking can be mighty risky
Joe don't let your music kill ya nobody cares

That song that you've been singing, it's not what you think
I know you've seen some sunny days
You love your music but you love your life
And there's nothing silent like a grave

Joe don't let your music kill ya
It's a thing that supposed to fill ya
It's a thing that supposed to make you happy

Taking pills and drinking whiskey
Picking can be mighty risky
Joe don't let your music kill ya nobody cares

Hunger can be killed with a can of beans
Don't let 'em tell you that I'm wrong
You got a good woman and she's got her dreams
Don't hang your life up for a song

Joe don't let your music kill ya
It's a thing that supposed to fill ya
It's a thing that supposed to make you happy

Taking pills and drinking whiskey
Picking can be mighty risky
Joe don't let your music kill ya nobody cares

Joe don't let your music kill ya
It's a thing that supposed to fill ya
It's a thing that supposed to make you happy

Taking pills and drinking whiskey
Picking can be mighty risky
Joe don't let your music kill ya nobody cares
